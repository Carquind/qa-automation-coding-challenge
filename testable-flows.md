# **Testable user flows, cases:**
   
### 1)	**Verify UI Elements:**
-	Verify that the header displays the correct title of the app.
-	Verify the presence of a search form with a text input field and a "Go" button.
-	Verify that the search result section is present and initially empty.

### 2)	**Verify Search Functionality:**
-	Enter a valid search term in the input field and click the "Go" button.
- Verify that the search result section displays a row for each repo found.
- For each repo row, verify that the name and description are displayed correctly.
- Click on the repo name of each row and verify that it redirects to the correct repo's URL.
-	Enter a different search term and repeat the above verifications.
-	Test with various valid and invalid search terms, including special characters and spaces.

### 3)	**Verify Search Activation with “Enter” key:**
-	Enter a search term in the input field but do not click the "Go" button.
-	Press the "Enter" key and verify that the search is activated.
-	Repeat the above step with different valid and invalid search terms.

### 4)	**Verify Search Activation with “Go” button:**
-	Enter a search term in the input field.
-	Press the "Go" button and verify that the search is activated.
-	Repeat the above step with different valid and invalid search terms.

### 5)	**Verify Missing Repo Information:**
-	Create a test repo without a description and verify that "-" is displayed in place of the missing description.
-	Create a test repo without a name and verify that "-" is displayed in place of the missing name.
-	Create a test repo without both name and description and verify that "-" is displayed for both.

### 6)	**Verify Search Feedback:**
-	Perform a search with valid search terms and verify that a success message is displayed briefly above the search field.
-	Perform a search with invalid search terms and verify that a generic error message is displayed briefly above the search field.
-	Perform a search with a non-existent GitHub username and verify that the specific error message for user not found is displayed briefly above the search field.

### 7)	**Verify Error Handling:**
-	Intentionally break the connection to the GitHub API and perform a search. Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed above the search field.

### 8)	**Verify Responsiveness:**
-	Test the application on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) to ensure proper display and functionality.

### 9)	**Verify Security:**
-	Test for potential security vulnerabilities.

### 10)	**Verify Performance:**
-	Test the application under various load conditions to ensure it performs well and responds within acceptable time frames.

### 11)	**Verify Compatibility:**
-	Test the application on different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

# **Prioritize the list of testable user flows:**

## **Priority: High**

### 1)	**Verify UI Elements.**
> Reasoning. Verifying the presence and correctness of essential UI elements is critical to ensure the app's basic functionality. This helps to quickly identify any issues with the layout and essential components.

### 2)	**Verify Search Functionality.**
> Reasoning. Testing the search functionality is crucial, as it is one of the primary features of the app. This ensures that users can search for repositories effectively and that the search results are accurate.

## **Priority: Medium**

### 1)	**Verify Search Activation with "Enter" key.**
### 2)	**Verify Search Activation with "Go" button.**
> Reasoning. While testing the search activation is important, it falls under medium priority. It is a common user interaction but less critical compared to the actual search functionality.

### 3)	**Verify Missing Repo Information.**
> Reasoning. Testing missing repo information is of medium priority. It ensures that the app handles missing data gracefully, but it may not be as critical as other features.

### 4)	**Verify Search Feedback.**
> Reasoning. Verifying search feedback is important for user interaction, but it falls under medium priority as it focuses on visual feedback rather than core functionality.

## **Priority: Low**

### 1)	**Verify Error Handling.**
> Reasoning. Error handling is important, but it is assigned low priority as it is more of a defensive mechanism. It is crucial to test, but not as critical as core functionalities.

### 2)	**Verify Responsiveness.**
> Reasoning. Testing responsiveness across different devices is essential, but it is of lower priority compared to functionality and critical error handling.

### 3)	**Verify Security.**
> Reasoning. Security testing is essential but is typically considered an ongoing effort and not limited to a specific development iteration. It is of lower priority for the initial testing phase.

### 4)	**Verify Performance.**
> Reasoning. Performance testing is important, but it is usually conducted separately and not as part of the initial feature testing.

### 5)	**Verify Compatibility.**
> Reasoning. Compatibility testing is important for a production-ready application but can be conducted in later iterations.
